## Cooperation Plan.

everyone of the team members has his strengths keys and we will use that as an advantage of our project so we can progress fast in the project, everyone of them will work on a side of the project which he has a strength in, then everyone will work on small tasks on all the project so all of us will end up understanding the whole project.


## Conflict Plan.

as a group we will deal with conflict as the following , everyone works on a seperated branch and anyone worked on something in the project and wanted to push the work he must notify us about the pushing and only the leader will accept the pull request on github , no one is allowed to push without notifying everyone about that .


## Communication Plan.

about communication between me and all the team members, we are comunicate on slack and zoom , we planned to be available on zoom meeting from 9 to 5 daily we can take some breaks from time to time but mainly we are available in that period, anything after that we have a slack channel we can gather up there , and if we feel we are starting to fall behind we will double the effort , for myself i have no problem working 24 hours just to get up with my team. 

the relation between my team members is built on trust and respect and everyone voice is matter and everyone is comfortable with that, we work as one unit not as 6 indeviduals , so long story short trust and respect is above all .


## Work Plan.

for project management we use trello board to manage task and assigning them to the team members, everyone will have his tasks to do, and when every task is completed the member who did it will notify us so we can test it and assign him to the next task.


## Git Process.

about the github , the one who is responsible of merging the pull requests is the team leader only and all the members will be there and watching the prcess, and about how often will we merge? well, depends on how the work is going and how fast the tasks are being completed , so when we have a merge we will all be on zoom meeting merging the branchs together.

about sharing the repo with my teammates we already created an organization on github and i assign all of them to the repo as admins.
